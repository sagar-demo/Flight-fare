Flight Fare prediton project is based on Regression type of problem..initially i took the dataset from kaggle.com which most popular for datascience platform.then started to Data preprocessing ,Feature engineering ,EDA,Featrure selection and many more techniques i used here...it was challenging for me because all dataset was based on categorical features so what i did i used lot's of like ONEHOT ENCODING,LABEL ENDCODING, to convert into numerical dataset form.. i also checked my accuracy which is 79.23% on test dataset .I have used also hyperparameter techniques also initially my acc was 79.23 % when i used hpyerparamerter techniques then it increased 81.23% on test dataset
I used  Random Forest algorithm for this project
